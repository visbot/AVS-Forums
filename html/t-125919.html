      I think we should append "READ ME FIRST!" to the FAQ and stop getting newbie posts about changing AVS presets and stuff...<br />
      <br />
      actually, I admit it. I look forward to newbie posts. Especially when Atero responds.</p>

      <p class="post-content">not really, i cant be bothered hating anyone though. Its too much work. Anyway its funny when noobs come and ask how to make their own presets and when they get a load of irritated regulars and bitch about it you come along and destroy them. :D</p>

      </blockquote>Nah, Tug and fçk (Well, that's the name fsk used in HIS packs...) are just using the fact that this forums is rarely visited, so not too many people would realize that the forumers are turning into drunkards. Besides, their motto is perhaps : "Eat, Sleep, Drink, Watch the pretty colors"<br />
      <br />
      For now, let the drunkards post (I guess...)

      <p class="post-content">Having many threads for many presets is fine. It's just the pointless threads that are crap. And Raz, I have also asked questions several times(120-polyhedron for one).

      <p class="post-content">Yes. You should enjoy all of your years. If not, then you are doing something wrong. You should be able to look back and say that you have had a good time overall. Small things don't really matter, as long as you are happy overall. This is what I believe anyway.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh yeah - the younger years. AND REMEMBER YOU TEENAGERS:<br />
      a) Fuck em all (even the ugly ones, they make the good ones taste better and will give ya something different to think about when your married)<br />
      b) Don't drink/smoke hard (I know its cool - until you end up my age and you've only got a hand full of brain cells left)<br />
      c) Don't give your teachers too much shit (one of ours died of brain hemerage and came back to haunt us)<br />
      d) Remember your mates (later on they'll be more interested in uni, work and their bitch girlfriend)<br />
      e) Always do the opposite to advice similar to b), c) and d) because, lets face it, its the best fun you'll ever have!</p>
