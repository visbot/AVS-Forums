Basically the exe included in the zip will convert *some* .bmps into a .gvm containing gmegabuf assigns for the width, height and the rgb data.<br><br>I call this a dirty approach for several reasons. Firstly (and most importantly) a .gvm is a lot bigger than the bmp it came from... and we dont store any more data... actually we store a bit less. Secondly it can only handle some bitmaps as I am far too lazy to handle all the millions of special cases and know that PAK-9 is working on a much better APE solution.<br><br>24-bit square bitmaps with even number width and height are all its supposed to be able to handle.<br><br>I won't support this or promise to develop this further, I'm just posting this as I feel a bit lame for having tools for doing this stuff easily... that others may not have simply because they don't know about bitmap files or c++ or whatever...<br><br>Included is sample .gvm .bmp and .avs as well as bmpconv.exe<br><br>it gives you help if you just type bmpconv.. for those too lazy to do that it works like this:<br><br>bmpconv mybmp.bmp mygvm.gvm &lt;n&gt;<br><br>where &lt;n&gt; is the offset in the gmegabuf that the data will start. gmegabuf(offset) is the width and gmegabuf(offset+1) is the height, the rgb data is then stored after<br><br>n.b. please dont base anything off of the example preset. its horribly unoptimised and is probably buggy.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th March 2005 12:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Since we're posting dirty tools<br><br>Converts an interleaved RGB .raw file into a series of gmegabuf assignments in a file for use with Jheriko's APE.<br><br>Like J's, quick dirty and unsupported :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th March 2005 12:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">i know i already posted one... but here is a second example (with source bitmaps) which implements a general case normal mapping.<br><br>its not particularly well commented, but the basic method is to do normal lighting i.e. light direction dot surface normal = brightness (capped between 1 and 0) with an attenuation factor got from the distance (i'll assume you can do that :P). then to apply the normal map each local normal is dot producted with the relevant components of the 'axis vectors' like (trivially in a non rotating static world) 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1... but these may be moving and rotating (when the object the normal map is attached to moves) so you need to recalculate the 'world normal' like this since the texture only stores a 'local normal'.<br><br>anyway... look at the code.. it probably makes more sense than my crappy explanation.<br><br>note, i have found a few bugs in my ape. one that seems to caus most crashes can be totally avoided by not using more than one instance. so in this preset i stuck the two gvms together so i could load it just once into one. am working on the fix and will release asap. in this zip is a 1.01 with //$notrans for faster eeltrans.ape working togetherness and also a few minor bugfixes (typo in help gone, filename length stored correctly)<br><br><br>attachment is rar in zip cos it just fits under the max size</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">TomyLobo</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th March 2005 14:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by jheriko</i><br><b>in this zip is a 1.01 with //$notrans for faster eeltrans.ape working togetherness</b></blockquote>you forgot to mention that this also needs a new eeltrans.ape, which you can get from <a href="http://tomylobo.deviantart.com" target="_blank">my deviantart page</a></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th March 2005 22:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">:)<br><br>Use eeltrans it make evallib into 'not a crap language'.<br><br>[/advert]</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ASD5A</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th April 2005 12:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">looking forward to an ape writing the actual rendered picture into megabuf.<br>That would enable relektions done with an superscope.<br>Btw. i´m currently working on a superscope which has quite realistic lightning and which own shadows affect the lightning of the superscope.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">TomyLobo</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th April 2005 05:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">you mean reflections?
