		Ahem!<br />
<br />
Behold! The first wa.com AVS forums *exclusive* preset from me! :D<br />
<br />
Wow... now that was special :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Basicly a preset with some neat buffer and blend tricks, a rather undynamic at the moment (no flow), but looks pretty cool :)<br />
<br />
Feedback is always welcome, because this isn't the final version (i hope)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and try to add an invert to make it purple! Looks pretty nifty that way too.

		3dino, Wrong thread? :weird: :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is an uptaded version <i>Microscope View</i>.<br />
The original feeling&amp;idea is pretty much gone, but it now has a flow dm and a onbeat flash XOR which looks pretty darn good if you get a good framerate :D

		Yeah, well not anyone likes XOR (i don't like it either most of the time) and that dm did take the original idea away... But to me it seems that it's not possible to make it flow without killing the original idea...

		Here's some ideas:<br />
Since it's supposed to be a microscope, try throwing a lens effect on it and having it zoom in and out and rotate around. This could turn it into a complete preset without destroying the original feel.

		WHOA! HEy! Do you even know me? I CAN'T CODE! Fux... All my code is just random stuff thrown together so don't expect me to code any lenses, rotations, or whatnots...<br />
<br />
But i'll try to figure out something like that... thanks for the tip.

		Alright Tugg. I'll try working on it. I've never done lenses in AVS, but I know the mechanics behind how they work.  I think I'm going to go tear apart Atero's lens right now to clear some things up and then I might start working on it.  And i'm sure you know how to zoom in and out, don't you? And rotate?

		I think you can get a lens by x=1/(1/f+1/x);y=1/(1/f+1/y); where f is focus distance

		I like it, but there seem to be a few glitches with the lens(or are the edges supposed to look like that?). I like it, though. Try making the lens focus in a little more you can barely tell it is zooming at all.

		Yeah, i don't think it is an actual &quot;lens&quot; just a lens-kinda trick with x&amp;x+y&amp;y i learnead way back from degnic&amp;jdm... Anyway i don't know how to make it otherway and the edges are looking like that because it needs a really big grid size to look smooth, also the blocky movement gets smoother the higher grid size you use.<br />
<br />
Currently the lens: Changes it's size, zooms between 0.5-1, flips on beat the lens screen (if random is true, otherwise not) and pumps j00 ass.<br />
<br />
I'll take the &quot;more zooming please&quot; under consideration, but i don't like heavy zooming, because it gets very blurry&amp;pixelated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And with beer... well i guess the old saying is quite true: The first one tastes bad and the last one is always too much! :D

		Jack, only swedish people die to it :blah: and it was Jägermeister+red bull that killed the couple of swedish (athlethics was it?) guys a year back or so... I think it has something to do with Taurin (or how do you spell it in english) that red bull has. As i know it Battery only has caffeine.

Hmmm, was it red bull, ok maybe...<br />
At the partyes the first ppl who are under the table are swedish. Heh, they just cant drinc (most of them).<br />
We, estonians are close to sweaden but we got more russian blood in us and the blood of the russian is like antidote for alcohol.

		just felt like showing some of the crap alt and the numpad can do 'cause i was really bored, im sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you (btw, bitching about it was a pointless post too :p) but lets not argue about such minor minor things...

		Hey, just trying to stop you and Jack from carrying on a pointless conversation.:p It doesn't really matter, though, this thread seems to have loss most of its relevancy. About 20 posts on alcohol. Couple more on useless posts.<br />
Back on topic, I'm still trying to figure out the lenses, and I've made a couple, but I wasn't pleased with them.  I think I might need to do some more research on them.

		Anubis, it's real nice to hear that someone cares about this thread even though it was i and my drunkyness that started the whole non-sense posting :(<br />
<br />
Well i have decided that v3 is the last version of this preset and im not going to uptade it anymore. (i did made some slight editing to it, but nothing radical) This preset will be now added to Finnish Flash 6 as an &quot;exclusive&quot; preset.<br />
<br />
Take care people, as i see it there is no point posting anything to this thread anymore, avs or even alcohol related :p
