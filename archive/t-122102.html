<div class="posttext">Ahem!<br />
<br />
Behold! The first wa.com AVS forums *exclusive* preset from me! :D<br />
<br />
Wow... now that was special :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Basicly a preset with some neat buffer and blend tricks, a rather undynamic at the moment (no flow), but looks pretty cool :)<br />
<br />
Feedback is always welcome, because this isn't the final version (i hope)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and try to add an invert to make it purple! Looks pretty nifty that way too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that's...neato ^_^ i think it needs a bit more color variation, tho.  i attached a color remix...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th January 2003, 09:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Pretty nice there. I liked it better without the colour changes, sorry Atero.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice use of the colour map Atero but the original looks better, im not sure why. Crap, Atero's goin soft on us, :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pretty cool indeed. I think I've saw effect like this somewhere before...could have been Evilrice..... Anyway, looks good &amp; I can't believe that You used green :P (and it even looks good ;) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">3dino, Wrong thread? :weird: :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is an uptaded version Microscope View.<br />
The original feeling&amp;idea is pretty much gone, but it now has a flow dm and a onbeat flash XOR which looks pretty darn good if you get a good framerate :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 14:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It looks alright, but for some reason I don't really like it. I guess I was expecting something a bit different. The DM is real nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 16:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">wow, i like that green for some reason. I usually hate something with lime green in it but that really is nice, looks like a crack and holes appearing, looks a little grainy at points but otherwise great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 06:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, well not anyone likes XOR (i don't like it either most of the time) and that dm did take the original idea away... But to me it seems that it's not possible to make it flow without killing the original idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 06:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's some ideas:<br />
Since it's supposed to be a microscope, try throwing a lens effect on it and having it zoom in and out and rotate around. This could turn it into a complete preset without destroying the original feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 06:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">WHOA! HEy! Do you even know me? I CAN'T CODE! Fux... All my code is just random stuff thrown together so don't expect me to code any lenses, rotations, or whatnots...<br />
<br />
But i'll try to figure out something like that... thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 14:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Alright Tugg. I'll try working on it. I've never done lenses in AVS, but I know the mechanics behind how they work.  I think I'm going to go tear apart Atero's lens right now to clear some things up and then I might start working on it.  And i'm sure you know how to zoom in and out, don't you? And rotate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">nixa</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 18:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I think you can get a lens by x=1/(1/f+1/x);y=1/(1/f+1/y); where f is focus distance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 19:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that doesn't seem to work nixa. It mainly just moves the image down and to the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2003, 22:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well h erer is a uptaded version of the preset, i mean an uptade of an uptade.. or maybe it¨s a second version of the first version so itrs an alternative uptade or something... anyway im at a friends place drinking beer so i can't really chat anymore... oh and the dynamove is ripped off from &quot;Tuggummi - Lens Flare&quot; preset which w2as in his response paqck so sorry for ripping off his work!!!!!!! who the hell he ever is... makes good presets though.,,.. although he can't code rfor sure... losetr... heheheh....<br />
<br />
anyway... let's see if i can move the mouse correctly to get the damn attachment to the post... whee hihihihi....<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh Happy Happyu joy jouy! I clicked the mouse button!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I like it, but there seem to be a few glitches with the lens(or are the edges supposed to look like that?). I like it, though. Try making the lens focus in a little more you can barely tell it is zooming at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah. It's all about single malt scotch whiskey on the rocks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th January 2003, 07:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, i don't think it is an actual &quot;lens&quot; just a lens-kinda trick with x&amp;x+y&amp;y i learnead way back from degnic&amp;jdm... Anyway i don't know how to make it otherway and the edges are looking like that because it needs a really big grid size to look smooth, also the blocky movement gets smoother the higher grid size you use.<br />
<br />
Currently the lens: Changes it's size, zooms between 0.5-1, flips on beat the lens screen (if random is true, otherwise not) and pumps j00 ass.<br />
<br />
I'll take the &quot;more zooming please&quot; under consideration, but i don't like heavy zooming, because it gets very blurry&amp;pixelated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And with beer... well i guess the old saying is quite true: The first one tastes bad and the last one is always too much! :D</div></div><hr />

As to drinking and driving, only idiots do it. People should know their limits, and the people thay hang with should know whether to let their friends go or not. It why here, the host is resposible for drunk party goers after they leave his/her house/bar/BBQ/whatever</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Jack, only swedish people die to it :blah: and it was Jägermeister+red bull that killed the couple of swedish (athlethics was it?) guys a year back or so... I think it has something to do with Taurin (or how do you spell it in english) that red bull has. As i know it Battery only has caffeine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heh yea, basic chemistry, kind of same as the drugs are with alcohol.<br />
Hmmm, was it red bull, ok maybe...<br />
At the partyes the first ppl who are under the table are swedish. Heh, they just cant drinc (most of them).<br />
We, estonians are close to sweaden but we got more russian blood in us and the blood of the russian is like antidote for alcohol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey, just trying to stop you and Jack from carrying on a pointless conversation.:p It doesn't really matter, though, this thread seems to have loss most of its relevancy. About 20 posts on alcohol. Couple more on useless posts.<br />
Back on topic, I'm still trying to figure out the lenses, and I've made a couple, but I wasn't pleased with them.  I think I might need to do some more research on them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Anubis, it's real nice to hear that someone cares about this thread even though it was i and my drunkyness that started the whole non-sense posting :(<br />
<br />
Well i have decided that v3 is the last version of this preset and im not going to uptade it anymore. (i did made some slight editing to it, but nothing radical) This preset will be now added to Finnish Flash 6 as an &quot;exclusive&quot; preset.<br />
<br />
Take care people, as i see it there is no point posting anything to this thread anymore, avs or even alcohol related :p</div></div><hr />
