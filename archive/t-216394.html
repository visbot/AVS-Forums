<div class="posttext">A sourceforge project is in the process of being created. <br />
<br />
If you want to be added to this as a developer (when sf approves the it) please post here with your sourceforge username. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to take an active role in this project, I've just been pursuaded by Cody to start it up. Heh.<br />
<br />
If you want to start tinkering now, the homepage is here: http://www.nullsoft.com/free/avs/<br />
<br />
However, please hold off on making any (big/important) changes until we have some kind of sourceforge-based source control going.<br />

double buffering on overlay while the editor is open<br />
visualisation that runs while the GUI is being accessed<br />
AVS as a plugin in other realtime/ non realtime packages<br />

<div class="posttext">*jawdrops* whoa. I cant believe this finally happened. Although i'm not so good with programming, i can imagine the possibilities of an Open Source AVS. Hopefully someone from the many talented programmers here would make the one wish we've always been waiting for, Make AVS faster...maybe with hardware acceleration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i guess we'll have to wait for that a bit longer.<br />
But including some common ape's into AVS itslef seems much more likely to me.<br />
<br />
But whatever you want to happen first, my main/only wish would be, that avs stays 'straight'. It'd be awfully bad if we had thousands of different crappy versions. So perhaps/hopefully/PLEASE new winamp-releases could contain the last (finished) open-source-AVS??<br />

(also i'm holding back with my wishes, cause i most probably won't be able to support this project much. :( )</div></div><hr />

Wow.. I spend a month or two away from the community after several years of active participation, and lo and behold, they make it open source. Looks like i'll have to start spending more time on irc again too ;]<br />

It also seems like the community has been growing while i have been gone, so hopefully we will have a few extra coders on board.<br />

I find this amusing. Like most of the population here, I got the meaning of the words 'open source' about 99% right the first ever time i heard them without looking anything up. It describes itself amazingly well in those to words imo..  <br />
<br />
yeah, even for me as a non-native-speaker it was clear...</div></div><hr />

I mean I have an overall 'feel' of what it is, but I want to be clear. Can't anyone sum up open source in a few sentences? not taken from a web site I mean. Layman's terms.

<div class="posttext">A program is created, or written,coded, in a certain language that can be converted to a language the computer understands. <br />
<br />
AVS is mainly written in the language C++. Once finished, the computer does not know what to do with it so it has to be converted first (compiled) so the computer understands.<br />
Like translating english to japanese.<br />
<br />
The written text is called the sourcecode. A normal program (.exe) does only have the compiled information. That's useless for a programmer.<br />
(yes, there are tools to calculate it back a bit but that's always horribly messy and noone likes to go there unless their lives depend on it)<br />
<br />
A programmer needs the information the original programmer wrote. That information's called the sourcecode.<br />
To see the sourcecode that created this webpage for example, click on [view]&gt;[source] in your browser.<br />
<br />
If the original information is not available, then it's called closed source.<br />
If the original information is available, then it's called open source.<br />
<br />
simple as that :p<br />
<br />
Another example: AVS visualizations are open-source; you can edit them in the editor window.<br />
WMP visualizations are closed-source. You cannot edit them. (AFAIK)<br />

but personally i think the main avs system should stick to making innovative the avs system to allow you to have as much control over your avs's as possible and still be able to be creative, and not just give you a load of ape's that clog things up and do everything for you in a simple way :).<br />

project registration on sf.net usually takes 3 work days. however, once not all required information is provided for a new project, it will be rejected without further notice (no email!). whoever registered avs should check his personal page (http://sourceforge.net/my/myprojects.php), where the status is listed.</div></div><hr />

So your volunteering to rewrite AVS for Xine?? That would be cool:]<br />
<br />
Any movement on actually recompiling AVS with the some of the newer practical APEs included in the dll?  I've had a go fiddling with some of the interface, most of which break the module I'm in.  Oh well.  It would be nice to integrate the AVStrans ape into the main render list options.<br />

<div class="posttext">actually, people are working on avs rewrite (for libvisual, which means avs will be cross platform, on the negative side, all apes will most likely need rewrite aswell). <br />
I could say maybe in moth or two there is something ready. It's taking so long because libvisual need some more schizzle on its own (audio rewrite, complete windows port, script... which is supposedly almost ready).<br />
It wasn't intended to replace avs or anything, but never know...</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there are other vis' for linux (libvisual?) but if avs and winamp existed for linux it'd be the shizzy yo. Of course, I'm a noob in the world of html, let alone c++ lol. If i ever learn though, I'd be helping! I know its an unreasonable request and codemonkeys are indeed only human, but hardware acceleration would be awesome.

<div class="posttext">Looks like this thread is about where it was when i last checked (a while ago now).<br />
<br />
I have a lot of time on my hands now, so I'm going run through the code and start commenting it and making it more accessable to all those out there that want to do something (and also so I can get my head around it).<br />
<br />
I think if we managed to get it working as its own application, and ported to linux, it could take off. I say that because linux, with all its driver issues, can't get enough of software rendering apps. So it's a match made in heaven really :)<br />
<br />
At the moment it uses some assembler features and other things that are dependent on the MS VC++ compiler, and at a quick glance, there seem to be winamp SDK stuff used all the way through it, so it cleaning it out could mean a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if anyone else has some immediate ideas, or has already started playing with it, please post here and let us know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">its great that avs is open source but you can't just magically expect some myserious strangers to start hacking up code and creating what you have allways dreamed of. in its current form its pritty unworkable, tied into too many systems. <br />
<br />
if someone were to work on the systems involved and make it into some nice clean code that you could, for example easly modify to work with something like XMMS on linux, im sure that then, the prospect of working on something, not just to port it to diffirent systems. but also to improve avs would be much more attractive.<br />

<br />
the xmms project peoples are kinda weird though.. i meen, they are kinda some people who made a program for windows 3.1 but refused to update it to windows 9x or something. they won't even update to GTK2, so the menus n stuff look awful for lots. the BMPx peoples seem nice though.. once they have some stable code anyway.<br />
<br />
i think maybe the evalib design needs to be rethought.. when you make code thats designed to be portable its usually simple and eligant.. and therefor, reasonably fast. when you make things to work on windows they are generally hacked up to bits to make it fit with the Win32 api.<br />
<br />
if someone got it too compile on systems other than windows and vc++ id love to take a shot and hacking some stuff, right now the only copy of vc++ i have is way old.. and not quite.. legal. so i do all my coding with eclipse, gcc, make and the like on linux. plus, vc++ isn't very good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That fridge thing looks interestig /well i've always been into fridges/. As you said - nothing on the site yet. But there is work on that project, right? Cause I don't see any posts in the last few months. Just asking so that i know if the faint treble in me should be allowed to grow into a bell ring or whatever. Sound really excitin, visual stuff has always been me home, but avs doesn't fit me big ass :rolleyes: :o</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, i really should write something up there, but i have been busy the last couple of days. i'm sure it will be updated soon, but there is no major development, and there are already  tons of bugs and issues... but yeah, check it out about once a month and i'm sure you will see it growing slowly until its done :)</div></div><hr />
