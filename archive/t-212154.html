<br />
The idea for Winamp Forums Compilation Two:<br />
Everyone sends two original presets that you've either created recently or (preferrably) for this pack.<br />
Those two presets should be presets that reflect 'you' as an artist, in other words, presets that fit your style. They should be remixable. That means, techy presets are allowed, but must be remixable somehow.<br />
<br />
Then, after the deadline (see above), I will mail the two presets to two participating artists for remixing. There, the second phase starts - the remixing. By having two remixers instead of one as we did in WFC1, you'll have to remix four presets (from 2 different artists) and mail them back to, let's say me for now, unless Jheriko or someone else has different ideas.<br />
<br />
After the second deadline (yet to decide) (when all remixes must be returned ), they're all bundeled to one big pack: WFC2.</div></div><hr />

i'm a big fan of pimpbot, since writing install scripts is such a fag and mistakes like not detetcting the path can be avoided.<br />

<div class="posttext">You mean you can only build one good preset in a month?<br />
<br />
C'mon.. just send two presets.<br />
<br />
It's more fun for the remixers and it's good for your status to have two presets instead of one (+ mixes of course) to show the masses :D<br />
<br />
For the remixes I wouldn't mind as much since there are two remixers now. (actually 4 remixes per artist would make the pack huge, I think ~3 remixes is a good aim)<br />
<br />
Reasons to have two remixers: More variety for the remixer + a slimmer chance of having non-remixable presets at all (not that anyone will be submitting those because you've been told in advance, but... :p)</div></div><hr />

Shylent (known only by those who frequent #FF) wants to join.. Opinions? <br />

<br />
Joking apart, as we already said in the beginning this project should be a pack made by the &quot;more or less frequent ones at wa.com&quot;. And since i'm running into some problems finishing my work, too (like everyone does recently...) i'd also say the more the better. So we could still concentrate on the remixing part.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">everyone sends in his work to wotl, who randomly forwards the presets made by two artist's to one participator. Then you have the opportunity to choose the presets you like most and remix them. Afterwards the remixes are also going to get collected and complied (together with the 'normal' presets) to one huge pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I dont mind doing everyones names and some obscenely complicated animation method on account of its all just 3d models converted to gvm and the z-buffering makes the occlusion quite easy.<br />
<br />
may 4th... that should give me enough time to finish the textured model preset that I am working on. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Heres a slightly better version of that text, with some colour change and more detail and some different subdivision to hide more z-fighting. The W is still a bit messy and i need to subdivide it more, also i left a few tris inside of the N by mistake and sometimes they 'pop through'.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any cool ideas for this intro let me know... as long as they revolve around 3d text i could probably work it in somehow :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">maybe i should have waited until i got bored of working on this for a bit :P like now... heres how it looks now, i put a point light at the camera pos instead of the directional light and added specularity, these changes look okay because everything is subdivided so much, infact combined with the fadeout in the background i think it looks awesome.<br />
<br />
feedback appreciated.<br />
<br />
uses the same gvms as the previous ver (wfc2_w and wfc2_r)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey that intro is awesome jheriko! :up:<br />
i don't know how much work it'd be. but what about starting the intro as it is and then moving the title a bit to the top. Now the names of the participants could appear from one side, stay a few seconds in the middle and then disappear to the other side. (Hope you get my idea.. ;))<br />
<br />
So, it would be cool if you could add my name in 3D text either! Going to send my preset to wotl in 5 minutes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st May 2005, 13:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you mean something like this?<br />
<br />
notice the almost zero z-fighting :)<br />
<br />
i had to put the gvms in a rar in a zip so that they were less than 102400... i'm sick of pumping my post count with continual attachment :P<br />
<br />
overwrite the old gvms with these. it colors the 'winamp forums' text gold</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hey cool! that's what i meant!<br />
<br />
But could you perhaps make the name appear a bit later?! Cause the two objects come too close in my eyes. I'd wait untill &quot;winamp forums&quot; is at the top, before the name should come in.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the lightning and reflections are awesome!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">denkensiefursic, goddamnit! such a long name that i had to rar the file containg the model for it before i zipped it. :P still it looks all the more awesome with bigger words... <br />
<br />
I havent subdivided that name yet so its very z-fighty, you can see how many triangles are there in some places.. i tweaked the timings and movement a bit more... tell me what you think.<br />
<br />
needs the previous files<br />
<br />
wfc2_n1.gvm<br />
wfc2_r.gvm<br />
wfc2_g.gvm<br />
wfc2_w.gvm<br />
<br />
i'll compact all the models into one file for the pack, or we could stick them in the subdir... whichever is prefered (one fairly chunky file or lots of small ones?) btw this is quite size hungry... its already about 2-3mb :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah yeah... but it's just so cool! ;) Isn't it possible in any way to reduce the filesize for the pack? I guess a 10mb packsize (containing all member's names as 3D-text) is a bit too huge, isn't it?<br />
<br />
for the 'gvm files: i'd say there should be only one file in the pack, just to avoid confusion. Some unfamiliar people might think that those files are broken presets and wonder 'bout it (delete them etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're gonna hate to hear this then: there should also be an 'h' on the end. denkensiefursich is how it should be.:p The forums wouldn't allow the last letter, only 15 characters. :(<br />
<br />
But besides the point, when I open the preset I don't see ^..^'s or my name. The &quot;Winamp Forums II&quot; renders, moves to the center, then moves up a bit more, and then I waited... and waited... and nothing came. Any clue why this is?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought about that, checked everything I could think of. I dl'd the past 5 zips and put them straight into winamp\plugins\avs. J said he included the latest version of triangle.ape in the first zip so I don't know...

sorry i didnt make the deadline btw. i was working on something but i had some work come up and am incredibly broke atm... i guess i can refashion it into something for my pack :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">did you make any other presets except the intro, jheriko?<br />
If so, couldn't you add them wotl? Also, then you'd have something for mysterious_w to remix! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">New entries are welcome (of course), but I can't promise anything about them. <br />
It all depends on who still likes some extra work within the deadline that keeps coming closer.<br />
<br />
So if anyone wants some stuff remixed, be fast and hope the other artists have no real life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">here is the other thing i was working on. its not finished at all yet :P<br />
<br />
i still need to finish a new lighting model and to change the camera and crap to synch with a dm. optimise the model by removing redundant subdivisions and adding new ones to remove some more of the z-fighting (there is some still there if you look at the small details and edges of the wings), then cut it  into thirds again and fill the engine holes with some texer ii... etc... basically... a lot more than a couple of minutes work :P<br />
<br />
check it out anyway. its just the model with a 'light at camera' hax lighting system so you can see the texture materials etc... its a 2 part rar file which i then put the 2 parts into zip so they would be under the size limit... sorry for the hassle. the uncompressed gvm is 3mb :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i couldnt tell you how long it took... several 'a few hour' sessions with winamp/sketch-up/objconv. The base model only took about 20-30 mins, but subdivision an adding details took up the rest</div></div><hr />

Along with Tugg, I'm wonding if WotL received my original presets. I submitted them twice, the second time with updated versions. One of my remixers PMd me and described receiving the first versions. Hopefully, though, the revised ones will make it into the pack. :)</div></div><hr />

Are on their way?<br />
Did you or did you not get my second email? :igor:<br />
<br />
You replied to the first one and said *coughattachmentcough* and then i send you another email.<br />
<br />
I did attach the file to both emails, i can see that i did in my outbox.  <br />
I never got the attachments, but your PM worked<br />
<br />
@MrNudge: my outbox shows I did send you an email.. together with the other artists..<br />
Strange.. I'm not using any email program, just gmail.com in Maxthon :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sure. You can have until about 20:00 your local time. <br />
Mail me if you need more.<br />

<div class="posttext">that's all right imo.<br />
(As long as it's going to be finished somewhen during the next days... :) )<br />
<br />
What about the problems that occured with the remixes/emails actually? Are those problems removed? Has every participant recieved/sent their stuff in?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yea thats what I am wonderin. Here's the situation - WotL experiences some problems with attachments and people never say anything and then all of a sudden on 28th Mr Nudge realizes that he doesnt have any presets to remix. I am wondering if this is even gonna happen. Sorry for being pessimistic and dont take offense, anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st June 2005, 17:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well, but wotl couldn't recognize it until tug asked whether his mail was delivered or not. So, of course this was 'all of a sudden'. True but sad. :frown:<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, let's keep at least a bit optimism! This pack will be released! :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is the first time I encounter difficulties with my email. (gmail in browser)<br />
<br />
I emailed MrNudge together with everyone else and noone else has replied to me they didn't receive the email at all. When MrNudge started about it in the forums, it was just a few days before the deadline. <br />
Tuggummi's first post didn't have an attachment when I got it, but did when he sent it away. <br />
I replied, and he replied back but didn't say he had re-attached it. Again, it was not attached when I got it, so I didn't know he thought I had it. <br />
We PM'ed each other about it and Tuggummi placed it somewhere on the web and gave the URL to me. I ve got his presets now.<br />
<br />
I don't really like it, but it seems like I'm forced to accept some delay again.. Hurry up, guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a pice of advice, maybe for WFC3 (but for god's sake let's at least have a 3 month break before even starting a thread on that). Don't take on jobs you can't carry out. These few months are my big dirty exams months, and I knew I wasn't gonna have a lot of free time. So I just volunteered to do mixes, and I got it done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Too late now anyway.<br />
<br />
WFC3 will not begin right after WFC2. I already had that in mind.. (If there will even be a #3)<br />
Let's at least wait until after the hollidays [sp?]</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, good idea!<br />
Perhaps i'll be able to round off some presets and complie them to my first pack during summer (what i've actually been planning to do for a few months now)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">maybe for wfc3 we have a huge deadline?<br />
<br />
so ishan is not in the pack and i can scratch his name from intro?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">when i got it right he just wasn't able to submit any remixes. So i guess his presets will be in!<br />

btw: what about the size of the intro? were you able to reduce it a bit? ;)</div></div><hr />

that i have massive probs remixing.<br />
well the wfc2 is released when pak-9 is finished.<br />
so my remix goes out to wotl during the next hours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">All's done for now.. But how will I add the .gvm files to the pack? Normally, I'd pimpbot it all since I've never touched NSIS in my life, but Pimpbot doesn't support .GVM files (yet?). <br />
<br />
Are there NSIS geeks around?<br />
Yathosho, will there be an update for .gvm files?<br />
<br />
other ideas?<br />
<br />
I'd try creating it with another install program otherwise, but it's 1 AM here.. I really don't have the energy to go on anymore for it today.<br />
<br />
I'll be awaiting replies until tomorrow evening (gmt+1) then I'll search around for other tools<br />

edit: i will not post it here; the pack is 16.1MB :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Question: Will people even download a 16Mb pack? <br />
Well, I, for myself, will, since im a participant. Have you thought about it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Your forgetting that nsis has support for ZLib, BZip2 and LZMA compression, and the largeness of the files is due to the .gvms (nice compressable text) so the final installer will likely be much smaller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">let's hope so!<br />
But i guess most people really don't care that much about the size. If it's worthy to be downloaded, they will download it cause it's cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The total size of Bitmapped II is 4,142 MB, compressed with NSIS i think the total size shrinked to about 1MB.<br />
<br />
So if we do the math based on this, the total size of WFC2 could be about 4MB~ which really isn't that much with nowadays internet connections :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am just an innocent bystander, and I would get this pack even if it were a 20 minute download. As ^..^ says, just 'cause it's cool. I can't wait to see the stuff you guys come up with next! I have even restrained myself from dl-ing J's Intro, or any other &quot;raw&quot; presets in this thread because I want to be surprised by the whole pack.:up::D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Final filesize: 1.001.624 bytes (1.003.520 bytes on disk)<br />
<br />
You can &gt;&gt;&gt; check (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19182254/) &lt;&lt;&lt; it if you want.. ;)<br />
<br />
that's about 3 to 5 minutes on 56k</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">YAY!<br />
<br />
Now we need UnConeD to lock this up so it doesnt get like the WFC1 thread :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: WotL size on disk only has meaning on your machine. I think it means the file + all its 'records' in the file allocation table</div></div><hr />

<br />
W O W!<br />
<br />
Congrats to everybody! That pack is awesome! :up: And please don't let this idea die! (though we really should wait a bit longer before planning another one ;))</div></div><hr />

Im still more beautiful than you.<br />

<br />
<br />
edit: Okay let's add some on-topic discussion.<br />
Next time i think there should be atleast some kind of quality control applied, if this thing gets too popular there will be disco-party-w00t-acid-trip presets submited like there's no tomorrow and are you going to include all of them? :igor:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shylent</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th June 2005, 20:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmm yea. I shouldve thought twice before submitting some presets I liked MYSELF, so I expected people to like them as well. That will be a good lesson for me. I still dont get how those colors are &quot;horrible&quot; tho :/ But, you know, thats just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how they did it? by simply generating everything procedurally:<br />
textures, music, voices, program code</div></div><hr />
