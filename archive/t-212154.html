      </blockquote>The idea for Winamp Forums Compilation Two:<br />
      Everyone sends two original presets that you've either created recently or (preferrably) for this pack.<br />
      Those two presets should be presets that reflect 'you' as an artist, in other words, presets that fit your style. They should be remixable. That means, techy presets are allowed, but must be remixable somehow.<br />
      <br />
      Then, after the deadline (see above), I will mail the two presets to <b>two</b> participating artists for remixing. There, the second phase starts - the remixing. By having two remixers instead of one as we did in WFC1, you'll have to remix four presets (from 2 different artists) and mail them back to, let's say me for now, unless Jheriko or someone else has different ideas.<br />
      <br />
      After the second deadline (yet to decide) (when all remixes must be returned ), they're all bundeled to one big pack: WFC2.

      <p class="post-content">You mean you can only build one good preset in a month?<br />
      <br />
      C'mon.. just send two presets.<br />
      <br />
      It's more fun for the remixers and it's good for your status to have two presets instead of one (+ mixes of course) to show the masses :D<br />
      <br />
      For the remixes I wouldn't mind <u>as much</u> since there are two remixers now. (actually 4 remixes per artist would make the pack huge, I think ~3 remixes is a good aim)<br />
      <br />
      Reasons to have two remixers: More variety for the remixer + a slimmer chance of having non-remixable presets at all (not that anyone will be submitting those because you've been told in advance, but... :p)</p>

    I've made four presets for this pack already, but I don't think they're exactly "remix-able", so I'm really contemplating even sending them in. What do you guys think?<br />

      <p class="post-content">ok, what about that: shylent posts let's say 2 posts a day untill the deadline. Then we can call him a frequent forums member ;)<br />
      <br />
      Joking apart, as we already said in the beginning this project should be a pack made by the "more or <i>less</i> frequent ones at wa.com". And since i'm running into some problems finishing my work, too (like everyone does recently...) i'd also say the more the better. So we could still concentrate on the remixing part.</p>

      <p class="post-content">everyone sends in his work to wotl, who randomly forwards the presets made by two artist's to one participator. Then you have the opportunity to choose the presets you like most and remix them. Afterwards the remixes are also going to get collected and complied (together with the 'normal' presets) to one huge pack.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Heres a slightly better version of that text, with some colour change and more detail and some different subdivision to hide more z-fighting. The W is still a bit messy and i need to subdivide it more, also i left a few tris inside of the N by mistake and sometimes they 'pop through'.<br />
        <br />
        If anyone has any cool ideas for this intro let me know... as long as they revolve around 3d text i could probably work it in somehow :)</p>

        <p class="post-content">maybe i should have waited until i got bored of working on this for a bit :P like now... heres how it looks now, i put a point light at the camera pos instead of the directional light and added specularity, these changes look okay because everything is subdivided so much, infact combined with the fadeout in the background i think it looks awesome.<br />
        <br />
        feedback appreciated.<br />

        uses the same gvms as the previous ver (wfc2_w and wfc2_r)</p>

        <p class="post-content">hey that intro is awesome jheriko! :up:<br />
        i don't know how much work it'd be. but what about starting the intro as it is and then moving the title a bit to the top. Now the names of the participants could appear from one side, stay a few seconds in the middle and then disappear to the other side. (Hope you get my idea.. ;))<br />
        <br />
        So, it would be cool if you could add my name in 3D text either! Going to send my preset to wotl in 5 minutes!</p>

        <br />
        notice the almost zero z-fighting :)<br />
        <br />
        i had to put the gvms in a rar in a zip so that they were less than 102400... i'm sick of pumping my post count with continual attachment :P<br />

        <br />
        But could you perhaps make the name appear a bit later?! Cause the two objects come too close in my eyes. I'd wait untill "winamp forums" is at the top, before the name should come in.<br />

        I havent subdivided that name yet so its very z-fighty, you can see how many triangles are there in some places.. i tweaked the timings and movement a bit more... tell me what you think.<br />
        <br />
        needs the previous files<br />

        wfc2_w.gvm<br />
        <br />
        i'll compact all the models into one file for the pack, or we could stick them in the subdir... whichever is prefered (one fairly chunky file or lots of small ones?) btw this is quite size hungry... its already about 2-3mb :P</p>

        </blockquote>yeah yeah... but it's just so cool! ;) Isn't it possible in any way to reduce the filesize for the pack? I guess a 10mb packsize (containing all member's names as 3D-text) is a bit too huge, isn't it?<br />
        <br />
        for the 'gvm files: i'd say there should be only one file in the pack, just to avoid confusion. Some unfamiliar people might think that those files are broken presets and wonder 'bout it (delete them etc).

        But besides the point, when I open the preset I don't see ^..^'s or my name. The "Winamp Forums II" renders, moves to the center, then moves up a bit more, and then I waited... and waited... and nothing came. Any clue why this is?

        <p class="post-content">here is the other thing i was working on. its not finished at all yet :P<br />
        <br />
        i still need to finish a new lighting model and to change the camera and crap to synch with a dm. optimise the model by removing redundant subdivisions and adding new ones to remove some more of the z-fighting (there is some still there if you look at the small details and edges of the wings), then cut it into thirds again and fill the engine holes with some texer ii... etc... basically... a lot more than a couple of minutes work :P<br />
        <br />
        check it out anyway. its just the model with a 'light at camera' hax lighting system so you can see the texture materials etc... its a 2 part rar file which i then put the 2 parts into zip so they would be under the size limit... sorry for the hassle. the uncompressed gvm is 3mb :P</p>

        <p class="post-content">I've decided that I suck at remixing. The first one went off without a hitch, but I'm having a lot of trouble with the other artist. If I can't whip something up quick, I may have to submit just one remix.<br />

        Along with Tugg, I'm wonding if WotL received my original presets. I submitted them twice, the second time with updated versions. One of my remixers PMd me and described receiving the first versions. Hopefully, though, the revised ones will make it into the pack. :)</p>

        <p class="post-content">Yea thats what I am wonderin. Here's the situation - WotL experiences some problems with attachments and people never say anything and then all of a sudden on 28th Mr Nudge realizes that he doesnt have any presets to remix. I am wondering if this is even gonna happen. Sorry for being pessimistic and dont take offense, anyone.</p>

        <p class="post-content">well, but wotl couldn't recognize it until tug asked whether his mail was delivered or not. So, of course this was 'all of a sudden'. True but sad. :frown:<br />

        Nevertheless, let's keep at least a bit optimism! This pack will be released! :p</p>

        <p class="post-content">This is the first time I encounter difficulties with my email. (gmail in browser)<br />
        <br />
        I emailed MrNudge together with everyone else and noone else has replied to me they didn't receive the email at all. When MrNudge started about it in the forums, it was just a few days before the deadline.<br />
        Tuggummi's first post didn't have an attachment when I got it, but did when he sent it away.<br />
        I replied, and he replied back but didn't say he had re-attached it. Again, it was not attached when I got it, so I didn't know he thought I had it.<br />
        We PM'ed each other about it and Tuggummi placed it somewhere on the web and gave the URL to me. I ve got his presets now.<br />
        <br />
        I don't really like it, but it seems like I'm forced to accept some delay again.. Hurry up, guys.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Here's a pice of advice, maybe for WFC3 (but for god's sake let's at least have a 3 month break before even starting a thread on that). Don't take on jobs you can't carry out. These few months are my big dirty exams months, and I knew I wasn't gonna have a lot of free time. So I just volunteered to do mixes, and I got it done.</p>

        WFC3 will not begin right after WFC2. I already had that in mind.. (If there will even be a #3)<br />

        <p class="post-content">Yeah, good idea!<br />

        Oh, Jheriko: after reading back this thread, kookee also submitted a preset + his own remix.<br />

        <p class="post-content">All's done for now.. But how will I add the .gvm files to the pack? Normally, I'd pimpbot it all since I've never touched NSIS in my life, but Pimpbot doesn't support .GVM files (yet?).<br />
        <br />
        Are there NSIS geeks around?<br />
        Yathosho, will there be an update for .gvm files?<br />
        <br />
        other ideas?<br />
        <br />
        I'd try creating it with another install program otherwise, but it's 1 AM here.. I really don't have the energy to go on anymore for it today.<br />
        <br />
        I'll be awaiting replies until tomorrow evening (gmt+1) then I'll search around for other tools<br />

        <p class="post-content">Your forgetting that nsis has support for ZLib, BZip2 and LZMA compression, and the largeness of the files is due to the .gvms (nice compressable text) so the final installer will likely be much smaller.</p>

        edit: Okay let's add some on-topic discussion.<br />
        Next time i think there should be atleast some kind of quality control applied, if this thing gets too popular there will be disco-party-w00t-acid-trip presets submited like there's no tomorrow and are you going to include all of them? :igor:

        <p class="post-content">Hmm yea. I shouldve thought twice before submitting some presets I liked MYSELF, so I expected people to like them as well. That will be a good lesson for me. I still dont get how those colors are "horrible" tho :/ But, you know, thats just me.</p>
